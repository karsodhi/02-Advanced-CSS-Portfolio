This is the second HW challenge that was presented to us.  I created a web portfolio with an about me, work, and contact section.  It was done using HTML and advanced CSS.  There are links posted within the portfolio with projects that I had worked on and left some slots for projects in the future as well.  There are also links to certain web pages in the contact me section as well as navigating links in the header section for this page.  When the screen is adjusted the page also adjust
